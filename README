GeographyDivisionSelect
=======================

---------------------------------------------------------------
				Description
----------------------------------------------------------------

Geography Division Select is a select tag which helps developers to display all divisions of the World. 
This plugin is similar to the country_select and state_select plugins and includes both mechanisms. 

Using Geography Division Select a user can
1. List all the Regions (Continents) of the world (based on conditions)
2. List all the Countries of the world (based on conditions)
3. List all the States/Provinces/Districts...etc., for Each(or more) Country(ies)(based on conditions)

The advantage of using geography_division_select is that you can provide :only or :exclude conditions for each type of drilldown and get more options.

Geography Division Select can be used by 2 methods

1. geography_division_select :- This is a general select option
2. geography_division_options_for_select :- This provides only the options for the select which can be wrapped around a HTML Select tag.

				Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------

Install
 * Run the following command:
   go to vendors/plugins folder and run the following command
   git clone git://github.com/heurionconsulting/geography_division_select.git
 

---------------------------------------------------------------
				Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

Geography Division select can be used in 2 methods

1. Select tag which generates the HTML SELECT and OPTION TAGS

geography_division_select(object,method,options,html_options)

2. Select tag which generates just OPTION TAGS which can be wrapped around a HTML SELECT TAG

geography_division_options_for_select(options)

The main entity that controls the display of geography_division_select is the options section. The main supporting elements are

:drilldown -- This keyword identifies the type of data to be shown as part of dropdown. Supporting types of drilldown are
	:drilldown=>"region" -- displays the regions (continents) of the world based on conditions. This is the default type of drilldown
	:drilldown=>"country" -- displays the countries of the world based on conditions
	:drilldown="state" -- displays the states/provinces/atolls/islands,etc., of a country(ies) based on conditions

:selected -- This keyword identifies which option in the dropdown has to be preselected.

:priority -- This keyword identifies if there is any priority selection that has to be provided along with the complete list. 
This helps if the developer wants to ensure priority for a particular country/state/region.

:only -- This keyword provides support to identify conditions for the drilldown to provide display of that particular or set of drilldown elements.
Only Conditions has to be used in conjunction of the drilldown type to identify better selection of drilldown data.

:exclude -- This keyword provides support to exclude a list of options while creating the dropdown options. Just like :only conditions, :exclude conditons
can be used in conjunction of the drilldown types to allow better selection of drilldown data.


NOTE:  

1. :only and :exclude conditions can have multiple drilldowns as part of the conditions. It helps in making correct query of options that are displayed 

e.g. 	a. :only=>{:country=>"United States Of America",:region=>"North America"} 
	b. :exclude=>{:country=>"India", :state=>"Karnataka"}

2. For any select tag both :only and :exclude can be used together.

e.g. {:only=>{:region=>"Asia",:country=>"India"},:exclude{:state=>"Karnataka"}}

3. Any conditions either in :only or :exclude you can use multiple elements (separated by comma)

e.g. 	a. :only=>{:country=>"India,United States of America, United Kingdom,France,Spain"}
	b. :exclude=>{:region=>"Africa,Asia,North America"}
	c. :only=>{:region=>"Asia,Africa,North America"},:exclude=>{:country=>"India,United States Of America,South Africa"}

4. By using Only conditions care has to be taken to ensure that the parent of the drilldown would be neglected. The various options are
	a. only has region drilldown -- both country and state are considered if they are part of :exclude condition
	b. only has country drilldown -- only state is considered if it is part of :exclude condition. if region is part of :only or :exclude condition it is not considered for calculation of states
	c. only has state drilldown -- only the state is considered. If region or country is part of :only or :exclude condition, they are neglected for calculation of list of states

e.g. 	a. :only=>{:region=>"Asia"},:exclude=>{:country=>"India",:state=>"Karnataka"} -- Valid
     	b. :only=>{:country=>"India"},:exclude=>{:region="North America"} -- same as :only=>{:country=>"India"}
    	c. :only=>{:region=>"Asia",:country=>"India"} -- same as :only=>{:country=>"India"}
	d. :only=>{:state=>"Washington"},:exclude=>{:region=>"Asia"} -- same as :only=>{:state=>"Washington"}
	e. :only=>{:state=>"Washington"},:exclude=>{:region=>"Asia",:country=>"United States of America"} -- same as :only=>{:state=>"Washington"}
	e. :only=>{:country=>"United States of America",:state=>"Washington"},:exclude=>{:region=>"Asia"}-- same as :only=>{:state=>"Washington"}
	f. :only=>{:region=>"North America",:state=>"New York"},:exclude=>{:country=>"United States of America"}-- same as :only=>{:state=>"New York"}
	g. :only=>{:region=>"North America",:country=>"United States of America",:state=>"New York"} -- same as :only=>{:state=>"New York"}
